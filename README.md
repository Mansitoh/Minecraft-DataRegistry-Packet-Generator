# Minecraft-DataRegistry-Packet-Generator
**Minecraft-DataRegistry-Packet-Generator** is a tool that generates data packets for Minecraft and stores them in files with the `.data` extension. The data is saved as a `bytearray`, allowing easy sending and manipulation of packets according to the Minecraft specifications outlined in the [Registry Data Wiki](https://wiki.vg/Registry_Data).
## Installation

Clone the repository to your local environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mansitoh/Minecraft-DataRegistry-Packet-Generator.git
```

#Alternatively, you can simply download the registry packet you need.😁

#The packets are without compression, they already have their length and packet id, you should just remove the bytearray from the file and use it in your code
